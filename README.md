<h1 align="center">Amazon Funnel Analysis</h1>

1. Project Introduction                 
An end-to-end e-commerce funnel analytics project that uses Python to analyze Amazon user behavior data, track stage-to-stage session drop-offs, analyze multi-dimensional drop-off drivers, and deliver strategic recommendations to boost conversion rates and sales.

2. Executive Summary & Key Metrics
Analytic overview across a customer interaction base of 10,000 sessions (21,676 event records) during 2026-07-15 to 2026-08-14:              
(1) Key Metrics:                      
1,068 Total Orders | 10.68% Overall Conversion Rate | $1,179,313.12 Total Revenue | $1,104.23 Average Order Value (AOV).        
(2) Primary Funnel Bottlenecks:       
The Purchases stage experienced the highest drop-off rate (70.11% drop-off from Basket Adds to Purchases overall), representing significant cart abandonment across the user journey.

5\. Python Code & Analytical Implementation           
(1) Synthetic Data Generation & Data Cleaning         
Generated 10,000 user session records using Faker with custom event conditional probabilities.       
Data quality checks, timestamp transformations, and duration calculations were executed seamlessly.       
View simulated raw dataset: [amazon_funnel_analysis_data.csv](./amazon_funnel_analysis_data.csv).       
(2) Session-Level Aggregation & Multi-Dimensional EDA         
Aggregated raw event logs into session-level records (`session_summary`) to evaluate conversion rates, drop-off rates, and Revenue per Session (RPS) across channels, devices, product categories, regions, and time periods.

6\. Strategic Recommendations       
(1) Cart Abandonment Recovery: Address the 70.11% drop-off at the Purchases stage by streamlining checkout UX and launching automated cart abandonment email campaigns, unlocking an estimated $2,766,724.01 in potential revenue recovery.       
(2) Budget Optimization: Reallocate marketing spend toward high-ROI channels, prioritizing Sponsored Brands (11.10% CVR) and Sponsored Products(10.45% CVR).       
(3) Regional Strategy Replication: Benchmark and replicate successful promotional strategies from Northern Ireland (11.26% CVR) across lower-performing markets such as England (10.26% CVR).        
(4) Category Promotion: Increase homepage visibility and ad placements for top-converting categories like HomeDecor (11.85% CVR) and Bedding (11.35% CVR).
